### Contributing
We follow [angular-style commit message guidelines.](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit)

To write code to solve an issue, branch off from master and name the branch with something unique and descriptive. We may open a PR at any stage of solving an issue, but request for code review when it might be ready to merge back into master. We can close the respective issue once the PR has been merged.
